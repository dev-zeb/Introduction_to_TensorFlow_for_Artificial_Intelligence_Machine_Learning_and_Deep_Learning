All the Lab Assignments' Solutions are available in this folder of the course
"Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and 
Deep Learning" (Coursera).

I was assigned the task to complete this course and solve all the problems and
keep the solutions to a GitHub repository by the course teacher.
